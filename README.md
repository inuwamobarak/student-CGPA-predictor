## Introduction
Predicting a student's academic performance is an essential task in the education system. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict a student's CGPA using various input features of courses of the semester scores. By predicting a student's CGPA, educators and academic advisors can identify students at risk of underperforming and provide timely interventions and support.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of historical student data, including features of previous semester scores. The dataset is not included in this repository, but you can find a similar dataset at: Pending: [example-dataset-link](https://example.com/dataset).
